* What's this?
  
  This is a extension of Emacs that provides the function for doing various action to
  other windows quickly in multi window situation.  
  In default, that's move, scroll and isearch.  
  Moreover, you can add the action what you want.  


* Demo

* Install
  
*** If use package.el

    2014/04/26 Now application
    
*** If use el-get.el

    2014/04/26 Now application

*** If use auto-install.el
    
    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(auto-install-from-url "https://raw.github.com/aki2o/owdriver/master/owdriver.el")
    #+END_SRC
    
    - In this case, you need to install each of the following dependency.
      
*** Manually
    
    Download owdriver.el and put it on your load-path.  
    
    - In this case, you need to install each of the following dependency.
      
*** Dependency

    - [[https://github.com/myuhe/smartrep.el][smartrep.el]]
    - [[https://github.com/aki2o/log4e][log4e.el]]

* Configuration
  
*** Sample

    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'owdriver)
(global-unset-key (kbd "M-o"))
(setq owdriver-prefix-key "M-o")
(owdriver-config-default)
(owdriver-mode 1)

(global-set-key (kbd "M-h") 'owdriver-do-scroll-right)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-j") 'owdriver-do-scroll-up)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-k") 'owdriver-do-scroll-down)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-l") 'owdriver-do-scroll-left)
    #+END_SRC

    - For detail, see below.

*** Set prefix key

    Set prefix key for [[https://github.com/myuhe/smartrep.el][smartrep.el]] using =owdirver-prefix-key=.  
    You can control target window by the same way as active window after pushing the key only once.  
    For detail, see [[https://github.com/myuhe/smartrep.el][smartrep.el]].  

*** Control without prefix key

    If you have the action which you want to do directly to target window without =owdriver-prefix-key=,  
    Bind key to the command named =owdriver-do-...=.  
    About the command, see below.  

*** Define command after prefix key

    You can define the control of target window by =owdriver-define-command=.  
    Then, the command named =owdriver-do-...= is defined.

*** Add key binding after prefix key

    The same key is bound as global map by =owdriver-define-command=.  
    If you add/change the key binding, use =owdriver-add-keymap= before activate =owdriver-mode=.  

*** Default configuration

    Here is the default configuration by =owdriver-config-default=.  

    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (owdriver-add-keymap "C-o"        'owdriver-next-window)
  (owdriver-add-keymap "C-S-o"      'owdriver-previous-window)
  (owdriver-add-keymap "<C-return>" 'owdriver-focus-window)
  (owdriver-add-keymap "C-q"        'owdriver-quit)

  (owdriver-define-command scroll-up               t)
  (owdriver-define-command scroll-up-command       t)
  (owdriver-define-command scroll-down             t)
  (owdriver-define-command scroll-down-command     t)
  (owdriver-define-command scroll-left             t (scroll-left 10 t))
  (owdriver-define-command scroll-right            t (scroll-right 10 t))
  (owdriver-define-command next-line               t (line-move 1))
  (owdriver-define-command previous-line           t (line-move -1))
  (owdriver-define-command forward-char            t)
  (owdriver-define-command forward-word            t)
  (owdriver-define-command backward-char           t (forward-char -1))
  (owdriver-define-command backward-word           t (forward-word -1))
  (owdriver-define-command move-beginning-of-line  t (goto-char (point-at-bol)))
  (owdriver-define-command beginning-of-buffer     t (goto-char (point-min)))
  (owdriver-define-command move-end-of-line        t (goto-char (point-at-eol)))
  (owdriver-define-command end-of-buffer           t (goto-char (point-max)))
  (owdriver-define-command isearch-forward         t)
  (owdriver-define-command isearch-backward        t)

  (owdriver-define-command pophint:do t (pophint:do :not-switch-window t))
  (owdriver-define-command inertias-up t)
  (owdriver-define-command inertias-down t)
    #+END_SRC

    If you mind it, you should do configuration without =owdriver-config-default=.  


* Usage

*** Change target window

    You can change target window by the following method.  
    
    - push the key bound to =owdriver-next-window= / =owdriver-previous-window= after =owdriver-prefix-key=
    - give prefix argument to the command named =owdriver-do-...= without =owdriver-prefix-key=

*** Turn back to active window

    You turn back to active window by the following action.

    - push the key not bound to the keymap after =owdriver-prefix-key=
    - push the key bound to =owdriver-quit= / =keyboard-quit=

*** Focus on target window

    If you want to change active window to target window, push the key bound to =owdriver-focus-window=.
