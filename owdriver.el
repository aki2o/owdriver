;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; This extension provides the function for doing various action to
;; other windows quickly in multi window situation.
;; In default, that's move, scroll and isearch.
;; Moreover, you can add the action what you want.

;;; Dependency:
;; 
;; - smartrep.el ( see <https://github.com/myuhe/smartrep.el> )
;; - yaxception.el ( see <https://github.com/aki2o/yaxception> )
;; - log4e.el ( see <https://github.com/aki2o/log4e> )

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put this to your load-path.
;; And put the following lines in your .emacs or site-start.el file.
;; 
;; (require 'owdriver)

;;; Configuration:
;; 
;; ;; Make config suit for you. About the config item, see Customization or eval the following sexp.
;; ;; (customize-group "owdriver")
;; 
;; ;; If you want to do the default config
;; (owdriver-config-default)
;; 
;; (owdriver-mode 1)

;;; Customization:
;; 
;; [EVAL] (autodoc-document-lisp-buffer :type 'user-variable :prefix "owdriver-[^-]" :docstring t)
;; `owdriver-prefix-key'
;; String of the prefix keystroke for `owdriver-mode-map'.
;; `owdriver-next-window-prefer-pophint'
;; Whether to prefer to use `pophint:do' for `owdriver-next-window'.
